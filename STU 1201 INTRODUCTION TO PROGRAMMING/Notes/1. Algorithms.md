## Key Terminologies
1. **Algorithm**: A step-by-step procedure for solving a problem.
2. **Pseudo-code**: An informal high-level description of an algorithm using English-like phrases.
3. **Flowchart**: A graphical representation of an algorithm using standard symbols.
4. **Sequence**: A set of instructions executed one after another.

## 1. Algorithm Fundamentals
> [!abstract] Algorithm
> An algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined, computer-implementable instructions, typically to solve a class of specific problems or to perform a computation.

### Characteristics of a Good Algorithm
*   **Precise**: Each step should be clear and unambiguous.
*   **Unique**: The same input should always produce the same output.
*   **Finite**: It must terminate after a finite number of steps.
*   **Input**: It should take zero or more well-defined inputs.
*   **Output**: It should produce at least one well-defined output.

## 2. Problem Solving Steps
To solve a problem effectively, developers typically follow these stages:

1.  **Decomposition**: Breaking down a complex problem into smaller, manageable parts.
2.  **Pseudo-code**: Drafting the logic using informal language.
> [!info] Pseudo-code
> An informal language that helps programmers develop algorithms. It is similar to English but mimics the structure of actual code.
3.  **Refinement**: Successive iterations of the algorithm to make it more detailed and closer to computer code.
4.  **Implementation**: Translating the refined algorithm into a specific programming language.

## 3. Standard Operations
The following arithmetic operations are commonly used in algorithms:

| Operation | Operator | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Addition** | `+` | `SUM = A + B` |
| **Subtraction** | `-` | `DIFF = A - B` |
| **Multiplication** | `*` | `PROD = A * B` |
| **Division** | `/` | `QUOT = A / B` |
| **Modulus** | `%` | `REM = A % B` (Remainder) |
| **Exponent** | `**` | `POW = A ** 2` |

## 4. Examples and Practice

### Example 1: Student Grading System
**Problem**: Write an algorithm to determine a student's grade. Input 4 marks, calculate the average, and indicate if they passed or failed (Pass mark = 50).

> [!example] Pseudo-code
> 1. Input four marks (M1, M2, M3, M4).
> 2. Calculate the sum of the marks.
> 3. Calculate the average by dividing the sum by 4.
> 4. If the average is 50 or above, print "PASS".
> 5. Otherwise, print "FAIL".

**Algorithm Implementation**
```text
STEP 1: START
STEP 2: INPUT M1, M2, M3, M4
STEP 3: SUM = M1 + M2 + M3 + M4
STEP 4: AVERAGE = SUM / 4
STEP 5: IF AVERAGE >= 50 THEN
            PRINT "PASS"
        ELSE
            PRINT "FAIL"
        ENDIF
STEP 6: STOP
```

### Example 2: Area of a Circle
**Problem**: Calculate the area of a circle given its radius `r`.

```text
STEP 1: START
STEP 2: INPUT r
STEP 3: PI = 3.14159
STEP 4: AREA = PI * r * r
STEP 5: PRINT AREA
STEP 6: STOP
```

### Example 3: Sum of Two Numbers
**Problem**: Read two numbers and output their sum.

```text
STEP 1: START
STEP 2: INPUT X1, X2
STEP 3: SUM = X1 + X2
STEP 4: PRINT SUM
STEP 5: STOP
```
