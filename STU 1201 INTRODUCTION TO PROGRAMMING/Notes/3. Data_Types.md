# Introduction to Programming: Variables and Data Types

## Key Terminologies
1. **Variable**: A named memory location used to store data that can be changed during program execution.
2. **Data Type**: A classification that specifies which type of value a variable can hold and what operations can be performed on it.
3. **Declaration**: The process of defining a variable's name and type before it is used.
4. **Initialization**: Assigning an initial value to a variable at the time of declaration.
5. **Format Specifier**: A placeholder used in I/O functions (like `printf` and `scanf`) to define the data type.

## 1. Understanding Variables
> [!abstract] Variable
> A variable is a name given to a memory location. It acts as a container for data that can be reused and modified throughout the life of a program.

### Rules for Naming Variables
To ensure code is valid and readable, follow these naming conventions:
*   **Length**: Maximum of 30 characters (depending on the compiler).
*   **Characters**: Can include letters (A-Z, a-z) and numbers (0-9).
*   **Start**: Must always start with a letter or an underscore (`_`).
*   **Symbols**: No special characters or blank spaces are allowed, except for underscores.
*   **Reserved Words**: Keywords (e.g., `int`, `return`, `float`) cannot be used as variable names.

## 2. Declaration and Initialization
Variables must be declared before they are used to inform the compiler about the amount of memory to allocate.

### Syntax for Declaration
```cpp
data_type variable_name;
data_type variable1, variable2; // Declaring multiple variables of the same type
```

> [!important] Syntax Note
> In C++, every declaration statement must end with a semi-colon (`;`).

### Assigning Values
Values are assigned using the assignment operator (`=`).

```cpp
// Method 1: Declaration followed by assignment
int x;
x = 100;

// Method 2: Initialization (Declaration + Assignment)
float price = 12.50;
char grade = 'A';
```

## 3. Data Types and Formatting
C++ uses specific types to manage memory efficiently.

### Format Specifiers
Specifiers tell the system how to interpret or display the data.

| Specifier | Meaning | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `%d` | Decimal Integer | `10`, `-5` |
| `%f` | Floating Point | `3.14` |
| `%.2f` | Float (2 Decimal Places) | `3.14` |
| `%c` | Character | `'A'` |
| `%s` | String | `"Hello"` |
| `%lf` | Double (Long Float) | `3.1415926` |

---

## 4. Escape Sequences
Escape characters are used within strings to represent special characters or formatting.

| Sequence | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- |
| `\n` | New Line |
| `\t` | Tab (Horizontal) |
| `\\` | Backslash |
| `\"` | Double Quote |
| `\'` | Single Quote |
| `\a` | Alert (Beep) |

## 5. Practice Examples

### Example 1: Basic Variable Storage
**Problem**: Write a C++ program to store the value `100` in a variable `a` and print it.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
    int a = 100;
    printf("The value of a is: %d\n", a);
    return 0;
}
```

### Example 2: Vertical Printing with Escape Sequences
**Problem**: Print the names of 5 students vertically using `\n`.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdio>

int main() {
    printf("1. Mwangi\n2. Adhiambo\n3. Kiprop\n4. Njeri\n5. Otieno\n");
    return 0;
}
```
