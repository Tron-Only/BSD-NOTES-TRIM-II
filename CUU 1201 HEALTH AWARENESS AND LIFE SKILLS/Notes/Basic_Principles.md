## 2. Components of Physical Health
Physical wellbeing refers to maintaining a healthy body through regular activity, proper nutrition, and adequate rest.

### Key Components
1.  **Cardiovascular Endurance**: How well the heart, lungs, and blood vessels supply oxygen during prolonged exercise (e.g., running, cycling).
2.  **Muscular Strength**: The ability of a muscle to exert force (e.g., resistance training, lifting).
3.  **Muscular Stamina (Endurance)**: The capacity to endure continuous contractions over time (e.g., planks, high-rep weights).
4.  **Flexibility**: The range of motion available at a joint (e.g., yoga, stretching).
5.  **Body Composition**: The proportion of fat, muscle, bone, and water in the body.

> [!important] Impact of Physical Fitness

## 4. Social Determinants of Health (SDOH)
SDOH are the non-medical factors that influence health outcomes. They often have a greater impact than genetics or medical care alone.

### Five Core Domains
1.  **Economic Stability**: Employment, income, and debt.
2.  **Education Access**: Literacy and vocational training.
3.  **Healthcare Access**: Provider availability and quality of care.
4.  **Neighborhood Environment**: Housing, safety, and transportation.
5.  **Social Context**: Community engagement and social integration.

> [!example] Case Study: Serena's Story
> Serena recently lost her six-month-old twins. She is grief-stricken, has lost significant weight, cannot sleep or eat, and avoids social contact.
> **Analysis**: While Serena does not have a "medical illness" in the narrow sense, her psychological grief and social isolation are severely impacting her physical health. This highlights the need for a **holistic** view of health.
