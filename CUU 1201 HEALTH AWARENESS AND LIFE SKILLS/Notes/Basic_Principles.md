	# CUU 1201 Health Awareness and Life Skills: Basic Principles of Health Education

Health is a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being.
Dimensions of Health
- **Physical Health**: Refers to the functional operation of the body, including physical fitness, nutrition, sleep, and the absence of disease. It involves the ability to perform daily tasks without undue fatigue.
- **Mental Health**: Relates to cognitive functioning, including the ability to think clearly, process information, learn, and manage thoughts. It involves realizing one's own abilities and coping with normal life stresses.
- **Emotional Health**: Involves understanding, managing, and expressing feelings, as well as coping with stress, adapting to change, and maintaining a positive outlook on life.
- **Social Health**: Focuses on the ability to form meaningful, supportive relationships with family, friends, and the community. It includes effective communication and a sense of belonging. 

Key aspects of health:
- Inter-relatedness - The dimensions are interdependent; a change in one dimension often affects others (e.g., poor physical health can impact emotional well-being)
- Holistic Approach: health is a positive proactive state rather than a neutral passive one.
- Broader Dimensions: Other dimensions include spiritual, environmental and intellectual
